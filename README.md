# Aquatic-Remote-Sensing-Tutorial-by-python
Hands-on tutorial on Aquatic Remote Sensing of coastal and inland water using python.

Here I want to sum up my past experience of aquatic remote sensing of coastal and inland water using python, to temporally end my journey in aquatic remote sensing.

I will talk about my past knowledge of remote sesning in coastal and inland water using python based on MODIS, OLCI, GOCI and Landsat/Sentinel.

Looking forward to the coorperation and questions.

# Outline
## Overview of aquatic remote sensing of coastal and inland water
## Python environment preparation
## Read and display of L2 product
## Reproduction of some commonly used algorithms
## Instruction and preliminary explanation of atmospheric correction
